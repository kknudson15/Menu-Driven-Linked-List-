# Menu-Driven-Linked-List-

Description:
This project uses a menu driven system to have the user perform operations on a linked list. The menu will be displayed initially and then the operations will continued to be performed  until the user quits out of the program.  The use is able to insert values to a list, remove values from  a list, check to see if the list is empty, see what the length of the list is, check to see if a value is present,  report back a value in a specific position in the list and re initialize a list to be empty.  All of these operations will be continued until the user selects the quit option on the menu marked as 'q' or 'Q'.  There is error  checking for the cases of the letters that the user enters for the operations. 

Data Structures:

Applications:
